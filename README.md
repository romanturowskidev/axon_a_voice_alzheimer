## 📌 Project Description  

**Axon A Voice Alzheimer** is a project that leverages **artificial intelligence (AI) and audio processing** to aid in the **early detection of Alzheimer's disease** based on voice analysis. The model analyzes speech samples and classifies them as healthy or potentially indicative of the disease.

🔹 **Technologies used**:  
- **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras** – AI model training  
- **Librosa**, **Scikit-learn** – Audio feature extraction  
- **Flask**, **Streamlit** – API and user interface  
- **Docker** – Model deployment  

🎯 **Project Goal**: Build a high-precision AI model to assist doctors and researchers in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease through voice analysis.
